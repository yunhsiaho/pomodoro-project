# Intro
Pomodoro app is a project made by Hsia. It's a challenge asigned by BECODE LIEGE code training center to practice how to make a basic React application.

# Mission objectives

In this challenge you will use and consolidate your knowledge on:
- Display a big timer (minutes and seconds).
- Four buttons:
        plus (+) and minus (-), they will allow the user to adjust the minutes counter - only when it's stopped.
        start, to run the timer (it will then change to stop), to serve as a toggle button
        reset, toâ€¦ reset the timer to its original value
        
At the end of the timer, show a modal to invite user to take a break. The modal will have two buttons:
- One to close the modal
- Another to close the modal and start a new timer


# Language used
- ReactJs

# P.S.
Personally I don't think it's a pretty work, I'll try to improve it when it's possible.
